                            <p>Chess is played between two opponents who move pieces on a square board called a 'chessboard'. The player with the light-colored pieces (White) makes the first move, then players move alternately, with the player with the dark-colored pieces (Black) making the next move.</p>
                            <p>A player is said to 'have the move' when his opponent's move has been 'made'.</p>
                            <p>The objective of each player is to place the opponent's king 'under attack' in such a way that the opponent has no legal move. The player who achieves this goal is said to have 'checkmated' the opponent's king and to have won the game. The opponent whose king has been checkmated has lost the game.</p>
                            <p>If the position is such that neither player can possibly checkmate the opponent's king, the game is drawn.</p>

                            <p>It is not permitted to move a piece to a square occupied by a piece of the same color. If a piece moves to a square occupied by an opponent's piece the latter is captured and removed from the chessboard as part of the same move.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The King</h4>
                            <p>The king moves one square in any direction (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).</p>
                            <p>There is a special move called castling that involves both the king and one rook.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The Queen</h4>
                            <p>The queen moves to any square along the file, the rank, or a diagonal on which it stands.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The Rook</h4>
                            <p>The rook moves to any square along the file or the rank on which it stands.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The Bishop</h4>
                            <p>The bishop moves to any square along a diagonal on which it stands.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The Knight</h4>
                            <p>The knight moves to one of the squares nearest to that on which it stands but not on the same rank, file, or diagonal. The knight is the only piece that can leap over other pieces.</p>
                            
                            <h4>The Pawn</h4>
                            <p>The pawn moves forward one square, but on its first move it can move forward two squares. The pawn captures diagonally forward one square.</p>
                            <p>When a pawn reaches the rank furthest from its starting position it must be exchanged as part of the same move for a new queen, rook, bishop, or knight of the same color. This is called 'promotion'.</p>
                            
                            <h4>En Passant</h4>
                            <p>A pawn attacking a square crossed by an opponent's pawn which has advanced two squares in one move from its original square may capture this opponent's pawn as though the latter had been moved only one square. This capture is only legal on the move following this advance.</p>
                            
                            <h4>Castling</h4>
                            <p>Castling is a move of the king and either rook of the same color along the player's first rank, counting as a single move of the king and executed as follows: the king is transferred from its original square two squares towards the rook on its original square, then that rook is transferred to the square the king has just crossed.</p>
                            <p>Castling is prevented temporarily:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>if the square on which the king stands, or the square which it must cross, or the square which it is to occupy, is attacked by one or more of the opponent's pieces, or</li>
                                <li>if there is any piece between the king and the rook with which castling is to be effected.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>

                            <p>Each move must be made with one hand only. When castling, the player must first move the king with one hand and then move the rook with the same hand.</p>
                            <p>Provided that he first expresses his intention (for example by saying "j'adoube" or "I adjust"), only the player having the move may adjust one or more pieces on their squares.</p>
                            <p>When a player touches one of his pieces with the intention of moving it, he is obliged to move it if it can be moved. When a player touches one of his opponent's pieces with the intention of capturing it, he is obliged to capture it if it can be captured.</p>
